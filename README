On the quest for Turing Completeness, here are the language constructs that
voice2code currently handles:

- Variables
- For loops (nested and non!)
- Printing output
- Conditionals
- Addition
- Modulus

Here are the language constructs that it needs to handle in order to be deemed
awesome:

- Pretty much everything

The plan moving forward:

- Support everything above ASAP, even if it's ugly code
- Refactor ugly code above
- ????
- PROFIT!!!
